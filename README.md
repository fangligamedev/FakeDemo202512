# Fake Demo 202512 - AI Strategic Platform

Welcome to the **Fake Demo 202512** repository. This platform is designed for the high-fidelity generation and showcasing of AI-driven product demos, integrating advanced visualization and data-driven simulation logic.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive toolset for creating "Pitch Demos" that demonstrate the potential of AI applications through immersive storytelling and technical simulations. It includes a 3D spatial canvas for product presentation and a backend integration for data-driven demo scripts.

## ✨ Key Features

- **3D Spatial Canvas**: An interactive 3D environment for presenting AI product concepts and workflows.
- **Data-Driven Demo Logic**: Support for YAML-based demo scripts and WebSocket communication to drive real-time demo interactions.
- **Localized Strategic Reports**: In-depth analysis and market entry strategies, including:
    - [报告博主版.md](file:///Users/brucef/Documents/LocDev/WebSite/ai-platform/报告博主版.md) - Tailored for content creators and influencers.
    - [报告5_海外冷启动.md](file:///Users/brucef/Documents/LocDev/WebSite/ai-platform/报告5_海外冷启动.md) - Focus on overseas market cold start strategies.
    - Other strategic documents in the root directory.
- **Asset Integration**: Centralized management of video demos, avatars, and configuration files for rapid demo iteration.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS.
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js / React Three Fiber (in `SpatialCanvas`).
- **Communication**: WebSocket for external script synchronization.

## 📂 Directory Structure

- `src/components/demo`: Core demo UI components and the Spatial Canvas.
- `public/assets/demo_v16`: Media assets, textures, and data files for demo version 16.
- `src/config`: High-level configuration and script definitions for demo flows.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To run the platform locally:

```bash
cd ai-platform
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the platform.
